\u2022 In this software, we define all instances of “dB” to represent decibels relative to full scale (dBFS). There is no simple way to convert dBFS to acoustical dB (e.g. dB SPL, dBC, or dBA) without at least requiring a full spectrum calibration.
<br/><br/>
\u2022 The dBA in this software is a simple minded, A-weighting dBFS measure.
<br/><br/>
\u2022 Some, if not many, mobile devices have a low-quality sampling rate converter. In these devices, one may see false spectrum lines (generally weak, while visible). To test that, you may generate a sine wave swap signal, then analyze its spectrogram using a different sampling rate.
<br/><br/>
\u2022 This software consumes power at a high rate.
<br/><br/>

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
\u2022 A full-scale sine wave is designated at reference: <b>0 dBFS</b>.
<br/><br/>
\u2022 All calculations of spectrum and spectrogram are done through fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the chosen window function, with a 50% data overlap.
<br/><br/>
\u2022 The peak frequency is found by identifying the maximum spectrum point, then correcting it through quadratic interpolation fitting using three nearby points. The error is usually smaller than one tenth of (sample rate)/(FFT length).
<br/><br/>
\u2022 This software will drop frames when the specified sample rate is too high. For example, a sampling rate (<b>SAMPLE/S</b>) of 48000, with FFT length (<b>FFT LEN</b>) set to 1024 results in a frame rate per second (fps) equal to:<br/> (SAMPLES/LENGTH)*2 = 48000 / 1024 * 2 = (<b>93.75</b>) fps, which is far too high for a mobile device.
<br/><br/>

<h2>Button operation</h2>
<font color="red">spum/spam</font>
<br/><b>spum</b>: Show the <b>sp</b>ectr<b>um</b> at each time point.
<br/><b>spam</b>: Show the <b>sp</b>ectrogr<b>am</b> in a duration. The color represents strength of the sound at a certain frequency and time.
<p/>
Note: <b>spam</b> mode expends more power to run than in <b>spum</b> mode, and may exhaust all available computing power (CPU/GPU) at high sampling rates. In this case, check <b>Preferences</b> to ensure you will receive a "Recorder buffer overrun" alert.
<p/>
<font color="red">dB/dBA</font>
<br/>Switch between dBFS and A-weighting dBFS. dBA is widely used in environmental noise measurement. But here, dBA is only for reference (simple minded A-weighting dBFS, instead of acoustics dBA).
<p/>
<font color="red">cursor/scale</font>
<br/>In <b>cursor</b> mode, touching anywhere in the plot area moves the cursor.
<br/>In <b>scale</b> mode, moving or "pinching" scales and zooms the x axis. Double-click anywhere in the plot area to switch to <b>cursor</b> mode.
<p/>
<font color="red">run/stop</font>
<br/><b>stop</b> freezes/pauses the display, making it easier to inspect the waveform. However, the recorder is still working when paused.
<br/><b>run</b> resumes real-time analysis of samples and unfreezes the display.
